# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This project is to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions. I've used the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from kaggle website (https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) for this problem. I've used stratified split method in order to split the data. Which gave better accuracy level than the normal one.
